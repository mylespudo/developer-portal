title: Rate Limiting
description: API Rate Limiting
---

To maintain a fair and consistent usage of the Myles API across all users and applications, we implement rate limiting. Rate limiting sets restrictions on the number of API requests you can make within a specified time window.

---

## Rate Limit Thresholds

Each API key is assigned a specific rate limit, which defines the maximum number of requests allowed per minute or per hour. The rate limits are subject to change based on your subscription plan and usage history
